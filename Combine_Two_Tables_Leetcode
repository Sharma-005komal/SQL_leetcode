Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table.
If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Person.firstName, Person.lastName, Address.city, Address.state
from Person
left join Address on 
Person.personId = Address.personId
order by Person.personId;
