Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id, 
case
when p_id is null then 'Root'
when id in (select p_id from Tree where not p_id is null) then 'Inner'
else 'Leaf'
end as type
from Tree;
